              Hello dear, I am Joel Ssenfuma, a professional software website
              developer and designer dealing in HTML and CSS.
            </li>
            <li>
              I basically enjoy creating websites and working together with
              other software developers to make browsing more educational and
              entertaining.
            </li>
            <li>
              When I am not web designing, I usually hustle on weekends to get
              some cash and also follow my hobbies such as gaming, gyming,
              swimming, eating, and watching anime.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am a born-again Christian, 21 years, a youth trying to make a
              difference. However, coding is a very important fruitful
              occupation that not only employs you but also exploits your mind
              to its fullest potential in making other people's lives a little
              better.
